# Title: Script for Downloading CERRA 3-hourly snow-fall water equivalent (sfwe) data

# Date: 11th December 2024

# Author: Vlad Alexandru AMIHÄ‚ESEI, MeteoRomania, National Meteorological Administration, Romania

# Description: Automates the retrieval of CERRA reanalyses data for the variable "snow-fall water equivalent"
#              It uses the R programming language with the "ecmwfr" library to download the CERRA climate data
#              Data are requested in 3-hour intervals from 1984 to 2021, excluding years which have already been downloaded
#              Data are processed in reverse order for prioritization                 
#              It...
#                1. Sets the Copernicus Data Store (CDS) API key for user authentication
#                2. Scans the directory containing already downloaded data to identify years for which data is missing
#                3. Constructs a data request for each missing year, specifying parameters such as the variable (specific humidity), model level, 3-hourly time steps, and output format
#                4. Sends the requests to the CDS API and saves the downloaded files in a specified folder with filenames reflecting the year and data resolution
#              Data are saved in GRIB format with filenames such as 'sfwe_03h_1984.grib'

# Inputs: Years of interest: 1984 to 2021
#         Existing files in the directory: "nc/cerra/sfwe"
#         CDS API key and user credentials

# Outputs: GRIB files for the variable "snow-depth water equivalent" 
#          Saved in the folder "nc/cerra/sfwe/" with the naming 
#          Format "sfwe_3h_[year].grib"
#          The downloaded data (output) has the following proprierties:
#            1. Spatial extent : domain spans from northern Africa beyond the northern tip of Scandinavia
#            2. Spatial resolution: 5.5 km x 5.5 km hence a grid box has an area of 30.25km
#               In the west it ranges far into the Atlantic Ocean and in the east it reaches to the Ural Mountains. Herewith, it covers the entire area of Europe
#            3. Temporal resolution: 3 hourly time step
#            4. Units: kg/m2
#            5. Projection: Lambert Conformal Conic EPSG:9802

# Prerequisites: A valid CDS API key configured using `ecmwfr`
#                Ensure the required libraries (`ecmwfr`, `dplyr`) are installed

# Instructions: Replace the placeholder API key and user details with your own
#               Run the script to fetch and save the data locally

# Load required libraries
library(ecmwfr) # For accessing ECMWF data services and handling data requests
library(dplyr)  # For data manipulation (e.g., filtering, transforming data)

# Set the CDS API key for user authentication (replace with your actual key and user ID)

# You can retrieve the key using:
# wf_set_key(service = "cds")

# The output should be the key you previously provided, for example:
# "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
