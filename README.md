# OptFor-EU_WP1 - Future climate projections
The scripts provided in this Projection-Data section provide code and guidance to download, process and re-project the future climate projections data for use in the OptFor-EU project. Climate projection data are from EURO-CORDEX Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations (https://euro-cordex.net/) driven by Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Global Climate Model (CMIP5 GCM - https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip5/) experiments.

Please take a look below for more information on each script and visit the OptFor-EU project website (https://optforeu.eu/) for more details on the project.

## Brief description of each file:

__Filename__: ReadMe_Download.md

__Description__: Provides steps and guidance needed to download future projected climate variables for use in the OptFor-EU project that are available from the CMIP5 EURO-CORDEX monthly data for future projections (2006-2050) covering the Europe domain

  ii) Harmonise - Rotate and regrid (to 1km) the native rotated polar coordinates to regular latitude/longitude grid for the Europe domain (West -44.75, East 65.25, South 21.75, North 72.75)
  iii) Output - Output the rotated and regridded monthly mean data, for each climate variable separately, for the Europe domain
