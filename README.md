# OptFor-EU_WP1 - Future climate projections
The scripts provided in this Projection-Data section provide code and guidance to download, process and regrid the future climate projections data for use in the OptFor-EU project. 

Climate projection data are from EURO-CORDEX Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations (https://euro-cordex.net/) driven by Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Global Climate Model (CMIP5 GCM - https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip5/) experiments.

Please take a look below for more information on each script and visit the OptFor-EU project website (https://optforeu.eu/) for more details on the project.
